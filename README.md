# RockPaperScissors
simple rock paper scissors game in vanilla JS

# How it works

We assign  0, 1, 2 to rock, paper, scissors.
For the computer the choice is radom, using a round number(math.floor) randomly (math.random).
Then we compare the two hands and apply the logic of the game to decide the winner.
The winner gets 1 point, the match can be a draw

# Beyond

Later this should be restyled and have better animations.
Add a reset button to restart the match.
Should this be a react app?
